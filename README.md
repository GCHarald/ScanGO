Hard to find pokemons on Pokemon GO? This apps allows you to scan your area for nearby pokemons!
The pokemons found are shown on map and you will get notified when they are close to you with push notifications!
The push notification works in background so you don't need to keep the app on screen to receive them!
You can choose to see just the pokemons you want!.

## WARNING

**Niantic changed right now (4th august 2016) responses from their servers, the app doesn't work until a fix to manage the changes**


## INFO

This App allows to scan the surrounding area to find all nearby pokemons and show them on map in real-time. It is not based on user reports so the pokemons found are 100% real. Each pokemon on map has its own timer to know when that pokemon will disappear. Clicking on a pokemon on map is also possible to receive navigation instructions to reach him.

Receive notifications when a pokemon on map is closer than a certain distance set by you!.

The notification system runs in background so it is not necessary to keep the app in foreground to receive notifications.

Furthermore it is possible to filter pokemons to just receive notification for those we are interested. So for example, if we don't want to recive notifications for the ubiquitous Zubats, we simply have to uncheck the corresponding box.

So to reassume, this app:
- scans the area to find Pokemons
- sends push notifications when a Pokemon is close to you
- runs in background!
- allows navigator instructions to reach pokemon on map
- filter your preferred pokemons!
- customizable parameters

**DO NOT USE YOUR MAIN Pokemon GO ACCOUNT**, because the GPS position is managed by the app and Niantic could think that you are cheating. Simply use a dedicated account just for this app so you can use both "Pokemon GO" and "Poke Alerts Radar" at the same time
